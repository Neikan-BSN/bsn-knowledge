#### Example Question Session

```
Topic: Cardiovascular Nursing
Difficulty: Intermediate
Questions: 10
Focus: Medication Administration

Question 1 of 10:
A nurse is caring for a patient receiving digoxin. Which finding would require immediate intervention?

A) Heart rate of 68 bpm
B) Serum potassium of 3.2 mEq/L ‚úì
C) Blood pressure of 120/80 mmHg
D) Respiratory rate of 18 breaths/min

Rationale: Low potassium (hypokalemia) increases the risk of digoxin toxicity. Normal potassium levels are 3.5-5.0 mEq/L. The nurse should hold the digoxin and notify the provider.
