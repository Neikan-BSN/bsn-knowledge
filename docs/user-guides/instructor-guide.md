- Demonstrate medication knowledge
- Prioritize patient care activities

Generated Questions: 10
Question Types: 7 Multiple Choice, 3 SATA
Difficulty: 3 Intermediate, 7 Advanced
Focus Areas: Pharmacology, Patient Teaching, Care Planning
```

**Generated Sample Question:**
```
A nurse is caring for a patient with acute heart failure. The patient's
current medications include lisinopril 10 mg daily and furosemide 40 mg BID.
Which assessment finding would indicate the need for immediate intervention?

A) Blood pressure of 110/70 mmHg
B) Potassium level of 3.1 mEq/L ‚úì
C) Heart rate of 88 beats per minute
D) Weight loss of 2 pounds since yesterday

Rationale: Hypokalemia (K+ <3.5 mEq/L) is a serious concern in patients
taking loop diuretics like furosemide, as it increases the risk of dangerous
cardiac arrhythmias. This requires immediate nursing intervention.
