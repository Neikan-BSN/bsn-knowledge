- **Evidence Citations**: Source attribution with confidence scoring based on evidence levels
- **Safety Features**: Conservative clinical scoring (max 90%), contraindications, monitoring parameters
- **UMLS Integration**: Medical concept extraction and terminology enrichment

### 3. Case Study Generation Engine ‚úÖ
- **Learning Objective Alignment**: Each case study mapped to specific learning goals
- **RAGnostic Content Search**: Retrieves relevant medical content for scenario building
- **Complete Scenarios**: Patient demographics, clinical presentation, relevant history
- **Assessment Questions**: Multiple choice and open-ended questions with rationales
- **Case Progression**: Multi-stage scenarios with decision points and outcomes
- **Evidence Integration**: Source-based rationales with medical accuracy validation

### 4. FastAPI API Endpoints ‚úÖ
- **Endpoint 1**: `POST /api/v1/clinical-support/b3-generate-recommendations`
- **Endpoint 2**: `POST /api/v1/clinical-support/b3-create-case-studies`
- **Endpoint 3**: `GET /api/v1/clinical-support/b3-health`
- **Features**: Complete request/response models, error handling, authentication integration
