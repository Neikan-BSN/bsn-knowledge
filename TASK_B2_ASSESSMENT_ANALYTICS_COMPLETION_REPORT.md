## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### AACN Competency Framework
```python
# Example: Competency assessment with RAGnostic enhancement
assessment_result = await framework.assess_competency(
    student_id="student_123",
    competency_id="aacn_1_1",  # Pathophysiology & Pharmacology
    performance_data={
        "assessment_scores": [85, 78, 92],
        "clinical_scores": [90, 85, 87],
        "simulation_scores": [82, 89]
    },
    assessment_id="assessment_001"
)
# Returns: CompetencyAssessmentResult with detailed analysis
```

### Learning Analytics Engine
```python
# Example: Comprehensive progress analysis
progress = await analytics_service.get_student_progress("student_123")
# Returns: StudentProgressMetrics with engagement, consistency, predictions

# Example: Personalized learning insights
insights = await analytics_service.get_learning_insights("student_123") 
# Returns: AI-driven recommendations and learning style analysis
```

### Institutional Reporting
```python
# Example: Generate accreditation report
report = await analytics_service.generate_institutional_report(
    institution_id="nursing_school_001",
