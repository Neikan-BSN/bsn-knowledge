# bsn-knowledge Project Plan System

This directory contains the automated project documentation and tracking system for bsn-knowledge.

## Overview

The project plan system provides:
- **Automated progress tracking** with git integration
- **Phase-based project management** with milestone tracking
- **Cross-project coordination** for workspace-level visibility
- **Historical documentation** preservation and analysis

## File Organization

### Core Tracking Files
- **`PROJECT_PLAN_INDEX.md`** - High-level project overview and phase management
- **`current/CURRENT_PROGRESS_TRACKER.md`** - Daily task tracking and progress updates
- **`current/DEVELOPMENT_STATUS.md`** - Current phase status and technical details
- **`current/PROJECT_MILESTONES.md`** - Milestone definitions and success criteria

## Automated System Features

### Git Integration
- **Post-commit hooks** automatically update progress tracking
- **Commit analysis** determines significance and updates appropriate documents
- **Branch tracking** maintains current development status

### Progress Tracking
- **Task completion** automatically logged with commit references
- **Phase transitions** tracked with completion percentages
- **Milestone progress** calculated based on actual implementation

### Cross-Project Coordination
- **Workspace-level integration** with unified status reporting
- **Dependency tracking** across multiple projects
- **Shared milestone coordination** for integrated development

## Usage

### Automatic Updates (Recommended)
The system automatically updates when you make git commits:
```bash
# Your normal development workflow - no changes needed
git add .
git commit -m "Implement feature X"
# Documentation automatically updated via git hooks
```

### Manual Updates
```bash
# Update documentation for current commit
make docs-update

# Check system status
make docs-status

# Generate health report
make docs-health
```

### System Management
```bash
# Setup/reinstall the tracking system
./project_plan/setup_project_tracking.sh

# Validate system configuration
python scripts/unified_documentation_agent.py --validate-system
```
