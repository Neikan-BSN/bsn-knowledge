# End-to-End RAGnostic → BSN Knowledge Pipeline Test Plan

## Executive Summary

This comprehensive testing strategy ensures production readiness for the complete RAGnostic → BSN Knowledge educational content pipeline. The plan addresses critical gaps identified in the existing 91-test suite by focusing on cross-service integration, resilience patterns, performance under load, and security validation.

## Current Testing Infrastructure Analysis

### Existing Test Coverage (91 Tests)
- **BSN Knowledge Application Tests**: 21 test files covering B.6-B.8 requirements
- **API Endpoint Validation**: Comprehensive B.6 endpoint testing with authentication
- **Performance Benchmarks**: B.6 performance validation (<500ms response times)
- **Security Testing**: B.6 security validation and rate limiting compliance

### Identified Coverage Gaps
1. **End-to-End Pipeline Integration**: Missing complete data flow validation
2. **Cross-Service Resilience**: No circuit breaker or failure mode testing
3. **Concurrent Performance**: Missing load testing with both services active
4. **Security Integration**: Gaps in authentication handoff and cross-service validation
5. **Data Integrity Validation**: Missing UMLS→NCLEX accuracy validation
