## Test Execution Sequencing and Parallelization Strategy

### Parallel Execution Opportunities
- **Phase 1**: Groups 1A and 1B can run simultaneously
- **Phase 2**: Groups 2B, 2C, 2D can run in parallel after Group 2A establishes E2E foundation
- **Phase 3**: Groups 3B and 3C can run in parallel with Group 3A providing resilience foundation
- **Phase 4**: Group 4B can begin in parallel with Group 4A completion

### Critical Path Dependencies
- **Foundation**: Phase 1 must complete before any test implementation
- **E2E First**: End-to-end tests (Group 2A) must establish pipeline before advanced testing
- **Resilience Base**: Basic resilience testing (Group 3A) enables advanced performance testing
- **Full Validation**: Complete system validation (Group 4A) enables production readiness activities

### Timestamp Tracking Requirements
