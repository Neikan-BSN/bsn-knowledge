### Core Security Tests (SEC-001 to SEC-007)
- **SEC-001**: Authentication Security Testing (JWT, token lifecycle, bypass prevention)
- **SEC-002**: Input Validation and Sanitization (SQL injection, XSS, command injection)
- **SEC-003**: Authorization and Access Control (RBAC, privilege escalation prevention)
- **SEC-004**: Data Encryption in Transit (TLS validation, certificate management)
- **SEC-005**: Security Headers and CORS Validation (HTTP security, browser protection)
- **SEC-006**: SQL Injection Prevention (comprehensive database security)
- **SEC-007**: Security Audit Logging (compliance reporting, audit trails)

### Advanced Security Tests (Standard/Enterprise)
- **DOS-PROTECTION**: Rate limiting, DoS protection, resource exhaustion prevention
- **CROSS-SERVICE**: RAGnostic-BSN Knowledge secure integration, service-to-service security

### Medical Security Focus

### Custom Medical Security Tests
```python
# Example: Custom medical content validation
@pytest.mark.security
class TestCustomMedicalSecurity:
    def test_custom_medical_content_validation(self, client, auth_headers):
        """Test custom medical content security requirements."""
        # Your custom medical security test logic
        pass
```

### Environment-Specific Configuration
```bash
# Development environment
export SECURITY_LEVEL=basic
export COMPLIANCE_STANDARDS=hipaa

# Staging environment
export SECURITY_LEVEL=standard
export COMPLIANCE_STANDARDS=hipaa,ferpa

# Production environment

```

### Performance Troubleshooting
```bash
# Check security test performance impact
python -c "import time; start=time.time(); import pytest; pytest.main(['tests/security/', '--tb=no']); print(f'Total time: {time.time()-start:.2f}s')"

# Profile security test execution
python -m cProfile -o security_tests.prof -c "import pytest; pytest.main(['tests/security/'])"

```

### Security Test Environment Validation
```bash
# Validate test environment security
python tests/security/run_security_validation.py --level=basic --output=env_validation.json
jq '.security_validation_report.overall_security_score' env_validation.json

# Check test dependencies
pip list | grep -E "(pytest|fastapi|httpx|security)"

  echo "HIPAA compliance violations detected!" | mail -s "Security Alert" security-team@company.com
fi
```

## üöÄ Performance Impact & Optimization

### Security Testing Performance Targets

The security testing framework is optimized for minimal impact on application performance while maintaining comprehensive security coverage:

#### Security Middleware Performance
- **Authentication overhead**: < 50ms per request (JWT validation, user lookup)
- **Authorization decisions**: < 10ms per decision (RBAC evaluation)
- **Input validation**: < 25ms per request (injection prevention, sanitization)
- **Security headers**: < 5ms per response (header injection)
- **Audit logging**: < 15ms per security event (async logging)
- **Cross-service security**: < 100ms additional latency

#### Medical Security Performance
- **Medical content validation**: < 200ms per medical query
- **UMLS terminology lookup**: < 100ms per medical term
- **PHI detection and sanitization**: < 150ms per content block
- **HIPAA audit trail creation**: < 20ms per medical data access

#### Test Execution Performance
```bash
# Performance benchmarking
time python tests/security/run_security_validation.py --level=basic   # ~2-3 minutes
time python tests/security/run_security_validation.py --level=standard # ~8-10 minutes
time python tests/security/run_security_validation.py --level=enterprise # ~20-25 minutes
```

### Performance Monitoring Integration
```python
# Monitor security performance impact
@pytest.fixture
def performance_monitor():
    import time
    start_time = time.time()
    yield
    end_time = time.time()
    assert (end_time - start_time) < 0.1, "Security test exceeded performance threshold"
```

## ü§ù Contributing to Security Framework

### Adding New Security Tests

1. **Follow Security Test Patterns**
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.security
   class TestNewSecurityFeature:
       """Test new security feature with medical data focus."""

       def test_medical_security_scenario(self, client, auth_headers, medical_test_data):
           """Test security with medical content."""
           # Your security test implementation
           pass
   ```

2. **Include Medical Data Scenarios**
   - Always test with medical content when applicable
   - Include HIPAA compliance validation
   - Test educational privacy scenarios (FERPA)
   - Validate medical terminology protection

3. **Add Compliance Tags and Documentation**
   ```python
   @pytest.mark.security
   @pytest.mark.hipaa_compliance
   @pytest.mark.medical_content
   def test_hipaa_compliant_feature(self):
       """Test HIPAA compliance for new feature.

       HIPAA Requirements:
       - Medical data access control
       - Audit trail creation
       - Encryption validation

       """
       pass
   ```

4. **Update Security Configuration**
   ```yaml
   # Add to tests/security/security_config.yaml
   test_categories:
     SEC-008:
       name: "New Security Feature Testing"
       description: "Comprehensive validation of new security feature"
       priority: "high"
       medical_focus: "specific medical security requirements"
       test_files:
         - "new_security_tests.py"
   ```

5. **Document Test Coverage**
   - Update README.md with new test category
   - Add performance benchmarks
   - Include compliance mappings
   - Provide troubleshooting guidance

### Security Framework Development Workflow

```bash
# 1. Create feature branch
git checkout -b security/new-security-feature

# Add tests to appropriate test file or create new file

# 3. Test implementation
pytest tests/security/your_new_tests.py -v

# 4. Run full security validation
python tests/security/run_security_validation.py --level=standard

# 5. Update documentation and configuration
# Update README.md, security_config.yaml

# 6. Commit and create PR
git add .
git commit -m "feat(security): Add new security feature testing"
git push origin security/new-security-feature
```
