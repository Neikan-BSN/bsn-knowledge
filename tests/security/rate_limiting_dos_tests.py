Comprehensive Rate Limiting and DoS Protection Tests

Tests rate limiting enforcement, distributed denial-of-service (DoS) protection,
API abuse prevention, and performance attack resistance for the RAGnostic â†’
BSN Knowledge pipeline.

Protection Coverage:
- API rate limiting per user and endpoint
- Burst traffic handling and throttling
- Resource exhaustion protection
- Distributed attack mitigation
- Medical content generation abuse prevention
- Cross-service rate limiting coordination
- Performance attack resistance
